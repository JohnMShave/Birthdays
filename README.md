# Birthdays

Ran out of time, so missing -
  * No tests, though obvious provision is made for them
  * No spinner when fetching
  * No paging for fetching
  
Left test as it's obvious how that would work and is clearly setup to do add them, so I felt it more important to deliver 
a fully finished working  implementation.

The/my hope from an applicant's perspective would be that's a realistic scenario and in a work environment there is something
shippable delivered.

Other improvements that were left out deliberately were further abstraction of the fetching and decoding (specifically an implementation
using generics) but - given the scope is supposedly a stand alone app rather than being part of a larger one - these felt like overkill.
